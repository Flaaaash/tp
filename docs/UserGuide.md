```

## Features
The list of features and how to use them can be found below.
User input lines will be of the form `[USER_INPUT]`.
For example, an input which requires a question number from the user will be of the form `[QUESTION_NUMBER]`.
For features with multiple separate inputs, the different inputs will be separated by a | symbol. For example,
an input with 3 different input steps will be of the form `STEP 1` | `STEP 2` | `STEP 3`.

"Last shown list" refers to the list that was last shown to the user. This list will be used for commands which
require a specified question index to carry out the command, more details in the commands 
[List](#listing-questions-added-list) and in [Find](#finding-questions-with-a-specified-string-find).

### Viewing the help sheet: `help`
Displays a list of the available commands a brief description of what they do. It can also be used to view the
detailed instructions for each command by adding the command name behind.

**To view list of commands**
This prints a list of commands that the program recognises with a short one line description for each one.

Format: `help` 

Example usage:

`help`

**To view instructions for specific command**

Format: `help [COMMAND]`

Example usage:

`help add`

This prints the usage instructions for the command `add`.

### Adding a question: `add`
Adds a question to the question bank. Follows a series of steps which require separate inputs each.

Format: `add` | `[QUESTION_TYPE]` | `[QUESTION_DETAILS]` | `[QUESTION_ANSWER]` | `[INCORRECT_OPTIONS`]

`[QUESTION_TYPE]`: The type of the question to be added.

`[QUESTION_DETAILS]`: The question itself.

`[QUESTION_ANSWER]`: The answer to the question.

`[INCORRECT_OPTIONS]` The incorrect options (only needed in adding multiple choice questions).

### Supported types:
- `FITB`: Fill in the Blanks
- `MCQ`: Multiple Choice Question
- `TF`: True/False (answer must be either `true` or `false`, case-insensitive)

Example usage for `FITB` questions:
- `add`
- `fitb`
- `what is 2 + 2?`
- `4`

Example usage for `TF` questions:
- `add`
- `tf`
- `is water wet`
- `true`

**Note**
* Input is case-insensitive and trimmed. For example, `   TRUE   ` and `false` are both accepted.
* MCQ questions have 4 options including the correct answer. When prompted to enter the incorrect answers, only input the **incorrect**
options one at a time.
* Invalid TF answers will prompt the user to re-enter until `true` or `false` is provided.

### Listing questions added: `list`
Lists all the questions currently in the question bank. Running this will change the last shown list to be the full list
of questions in the question bank again. List can be used to show the question list with or without answers.

**To show the list of questions without answers**

Format: `list`

Example usage:

`list`

**To show the list of questions with answers**

Format: `list answer`

Example usage:

`list answer`

### Finding questions with a specified string: `find`
Finds all questions currently in the question bank that contain a specific keyword. Running this will change the last shown list to be the list of
questions which match the user's search query in the question bank. Find can be used to search for all question types,
or specifically for MCQ, FITB and TF questions

**To search for all questions containing `KEYWORD`**

Format: `find [KEYWORD]`

Example usage:

`find MRT`

Example output:

```
==============================
Here are the questions with MRT:
==============================
==============================
1. FITB: What is the closest MRT to NUS?
2. MCQ: What MRT station on EWL is closest to NUS?
A. Clementi MRT
B. Buona Vista MRT
C. Dover MRT
D. Redhill MRT
3. TF: Lakeside MRT is the best.
==============================
```

**To search for all MCQ questions containing `KEYWORD`**

Format: `find mcq [KEYWORD]`

Example usage:

`find mcq MRT`

Example output:
```
==============================
Here are the questions with MRT:
==============================
==============================
1. MCQ: What MRT station on EWL is closest to NUS?
A. Buona Vista MRT
B. Dover MRT
C. Clementi MRT
D. Redhill MRT
==============================
```

**To search for all FITB questions containing `KEYWORD`**

Format: `find fitb [KEYWORD]`

Example usage:

`find fitb MRT`

Example output:

```
==============================
Here are the questions with MRT:
==============================
==============================
1. FITB: What is the closest MRT to NUS?
==============================
==============================
```

**To search for all TF questions containing `KEYWORD`**

Format: `find tf [KEYWORD]`

Example usage:

`find tf MRT`

Example output:

```
==============================
Here are the questions with MRT:
==============================
==============================
1. TF: There are 100 MRT stations in Singapore.
==============================
==============================
```

### Solving questions: `solve`
Solves a question that was previously added to the question bank.
It is recommended to run `list` before `solve` to check the index of the question you intend to solve.
If one runs `find` before `solve`, the list used for the available questions and question indexes will be what is
displayed by the `find` command, i.e. the last shown list.
    
* For example, if `find 1+` has
  > 1. FITB: What is 1+1?
  > 2. FITB: What is 1+2?
* Question Index 1 will be the question "What is 1+1?".

Format: `solve [QUESTION INDEX]` | `[QUESTION ANSWER]` | `[Y/N]` (only if wrong)
`[QUESTION_INDEX]`: The question number of the question to be solved, according to the last shown list.
`[QUESTION_ANSWER]`: The answer to the question.
`[Y/N]`: Y or N depending on whether you want to keep attempting the question or not.

Example usage:
These examples are for a FITB question 2, "What are fries made of?" with the correct answer "Potato".

Correct answer example and outputs
1. `solve 2`
```
==============================
Attempting question 2: FITB: What are fries made of? Enter your answer:
==============================
```
2. `Potato`
```
==============================
Correct!
==============================
```

Wrong answer example and outputs
1. `solve 2`
```
==============================
Attempting question 2: FITB: What are fries made of? Enter your answer:
==============================
```
2. `Cheese`
```
==============================
Wrong answer, would you like to try again? [Y/N]
==============================
```
3. `N`
```
==============================
Giving up on question.
==============================
```

OR

4. `Y`
```
==============================
Enter your answer to try again:
==============================
```

These examples are for an MCQ question 2 "What are fries made of?" with the correct answer "Potato" and other options
"Cheese", "Ham" and "Bread". Instead of entering the answer contents, enter the answer's option instead. E.g. for the
option `A. Potato`, enter 'A'.

1. `solve 2`
```
==============================
Attempting question 2: MCQ: What are fries made of? 
A. Bread  
B. Ham  
C. Potato  
D. Cheese  

Enter your answer:
==============================
```
2. `C`
```
==============================
Correct!
==============================
```

These examples are for a TF question 2, "Fries are made of potatoes" with the correct answer "true".

1. `solve 2`
```
==============================
Attempting question 2: TF: Fries are made of potatoes (True/False)
Enter your answer:
==============================
```
2. `true`
```
==============================
Correct!
==============================
```

The wrong answer sequence for the above MCQ and TF questions follows that of the FITB questions.


**Note**:
* The MCQ question options are randomised each time to aid remembering the right answer contents instead of remembering
the right letter.
* If the question bank is empty (refers to the last shown list as well), the program will ask you to add a question.
* Follow the command format as specified above, incorrect formats will result in errors.
* Ensure that question indexes are within 1 to the number of questions, entering otherwise will result in errors.
* Entering other strings that are neither Y nor N to try again will result in the program continuously asking for Y 
or N until one of them is entered. This is to give the user a chance to actually enter Y or N.

### Editing questions: `edit`

Edits a question that was previously added to the question bank.
It is recommended to run `list` before `solve` to check the index of the question you intend to edit.
If one runs `find` before `edit`, the list used for editing questions and question indexes will be what is
displayed by the `find` command, i.e. the last shown list.

Format: `edit [QUESTION_INDEX] [QUESTION_ATTRIBUTES]` | `[NEW_QUESTION_ATTRIBUTES]`

`[QUESTION_INDEX]`: The question number of the question to be solved, according to the last shown list.
`[QUESTION_ATTRIBUTES]`: The specific part of the question to modify:
- q - question content
- a - question answer
- o - incorrect options *(only applicable to multiple-choice questions)*

`NEW_QUESTION_ATTRIBUTE`: The updated content for the specified attribute.

Example usage:

These examples are for a FITB question 2, "Where is Singapore located?" with a stored answer "North America".

1. `edit 2 q`
```
==============================
Editing FITB: Where is Siingapore located? [Answer: North America] 
 Please enter the new answer:
==============================
```
2. `Asia`
```
==============================
Question successfully edited: FITB: Where is Singapore located? [Answer: Asia]
==============================
```

These examples are for a MCQ question 1, "What are fries made of?" with answer "Potato" and incorrect options "Tomato" "Cheese" and "Apple".

1. `edit 1 o`
```
==============================
Editing MCQ: What are fries made of? [Answer: Potato] 
 Please enter the new option:
==============================
```
2. `Banana`
```
==============================
Please enter the next option:
==============================
```
3. `Lettuce`
```
==============================
Please enter the next option:
==============================
```
4. `Orange`
```
==============================
Question successfully edited: MCQ: What are fries made of? [Answer: Potato]
==============================
```

These examples are for a TF question 1, "Burgers are made of potatoes" with the correct answer "true".

1. `edit 1 a`
```
==============================
Editing TF: Burgers are made of potatoes [Answer: true]
 Please enter the new answer:
==============================
```
2. `false`
```
==============================
Question successfully edited: TF: Burgers are made of potatoes [Answer: false]
==============================
```

**Note**:
- If the input is empty, an error message will prompt the user to enter a valid value.

- When editing multiple-choice options, the system will prompt for three options sequentially.

### Deleting a question: `delete`
Removes a question from the question bank. The question index should refer to the index displayed by the most recent `list` or `find` command.

Format: `delete [QUESTION_INDEX]`

- `[QUESTION_INDEX]`: The number of the question to be deleted, as seen in the last shown list.

Example usage:

```
list
==============================
1. FITB: 1 + 1 = __
2. FITB: The capital of France is __
==============================
delete 1
Deleted question: FITB: 1 + 1 = __ [Answer: 2]
```

```
find fitb 1 +
==============================
1. FITB: 1 + 1 = __
2. FITB: 1 + 2 = __
==============================
delete 2
Deleted question: FITB: 1 + 2 = __ [Answer: 3]
```

**Notes:**
* The question index is based on the most recently displayed question list (via `list` or `find`).
* Attempting to delete an index that does not exist in the last shown list will result in an error.
* This command is **single-step** and does not support multistep usage.

### Exiting the program: `exit`
Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

Example usage: 

`exit`

## Saving and Loading of Data

### Saving
* Questions are automatically saved every time the question bank is modified (e.g., when you add, delete, or edit a question).

* There is no need to manually save — this is handled behind the scenes.

* The save file uses a custom delimiter (as defined in the program's configuration via `Messages.STORAGE_DELIMITER`) to separate the fields of each question.
* Do NOT at any point enter the `Messages.STORAGE_DELIMITER` string into the input as it will ruin the save and load logic

### File Format
The file follows a structured format to allow for proper parsing:

* `[QUESTION_TYPE]|[QUESTION_TEXT]|[ANSWER]` (for FITB and TF)
* `[QUESTION_TYPE]|[QUESTION_TEXT]|[OPTION1]|[OPTION2]|[OPTION3]|[OPTION4]` (for MCQ)

#### Example: 
* Fill-in-the-Blanks questions: FITB|What is 2+2?|4

* Multiple Choice Questions: MCQ|What is 2+2?|4|3|5|6

* True/False questions: TF|The sky is blue|true

Note that | in the above examples represent `Messages.STORAGE_DELIMITER`

### Loading
* Upon startup, MindExpander will automatically read and load all questions from the MindExpander.txt file (if it exists).
* If the file is missing or empty, a new question bank will be initialised.
* Only properly formatted lines will be loaded. Malformed entries will be skipped.
* Lines that are incorrectly formatted by the user manually modifying the text file risk being skipped.

## Logged data
To improve user experience, MindExpander keeps track of some data throughout the use of the program.
The log files are generated and stored in a logs folder that will be created when the user first does
something that will be logged (see log features below).

**Log features**  

Users may find these logs useful for their specific purposes.

1. Solve attempts: Stored in `solveAttemptLogs.txt`, tracks the time of attempt, the question attempted and if the user
got the question correct or wrong in the format `Timestamp|Question|Result`. This is useful for seeing, for example, which questions
are constantly attempted and gotten wrong.

## Additional notes for program features and usage
* This program is designed to take inputs in **Roman Alphabet** (i.e. English characters),
please do not enter characters from other languages, for example Chinese characters.
* Inputting unrecognised commands will result in an error message.
* Commands are __not__ case sensitive (i.e. ADD, LIsT are accepted).

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Data can be transferred by copying over the `data` folder containing `MindExpander.txt` and pasting it in the
same folder where the .jar file is installed on the new computer.

**Q**: Can I add questions to the question bank while the program is running?

**A**: No, the new questions will not be recorded. Do not edit the save file while the program is running.

**Q**: Will questions I add to the save file before running the program be added to the list?

**A**: Yes, provided that the questions are in the correct format. However, this is highly not recommended due to risk
of getting the format wrong.
